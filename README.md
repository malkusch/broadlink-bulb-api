# Broadlink Bulb Java API

This is a Java API for the Broadlight Smart bulbs (LB1). This is an addition to [`broadlink-java-api`](https://github.com/mob41/broadlink-java-api)
which doesn't support this device. Also [`python-broadlink`](https://github.com/mjg59/python-broadlink/) was a great resource to implement this API.

## Maven

This package is available in Maven central:
```xml maven
<dependency>
  <groupId>de.malkusch</groupId>
  <artifactId>broadlink-bulb-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.5</version>
</dependency>
